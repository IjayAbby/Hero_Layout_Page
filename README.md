# HNGi7 Internship Task
*Hero_Layout_Page.*
Creating a simple Hero Layout page.
A hero image is a large or oversized web banner image that is pinned to the header section of
a webpage, usually towards the top of the page. Because of its prominent place in the site's 
visual hierarchy, the hero header is often the first thing users see when arriving on a website.
Here, I have built a Carousel/slider design where the hero page has more than one picture, can 
either be in sliding motion or one scrolls physically.
I created one with pure HTML,CSS & JS while created another with UIKIT Framework.
*UIKIT FRAMEWORK*
It is a lightweight and modular frontend framework for developing fast and powerful
web interfaces.
It contais a compiled CSS & JS files, besides the HTML Markup.
The Sass version allows you to include customizations in the build process, rather than manually 
overwriting a lot of CSS rules by hand.
NOTE Sass allows two different syntax version: Sass and SCSS. UIkit makes use of the SCSS syntax.
Browser support
UIKIT works on LATEST browser versions.
